Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
All commits should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard, if possible. If pushing a big change or feature request, please create a new branch if possible. Remember to:
- Review your code
- Write strict Luau if possible
- Don't hardcode values
- Passthrough a linter (e.g. StyLua)
- Use modern alternatives rather than deprecated functions (CollectionService, Tags, etc)
